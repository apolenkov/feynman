All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## 1.3.0 - 2026-05-25

### Features

- **`--fix` expanded to 4 autofix patterns** (conservative-first heuristics,
  idempotent, ±3 column guard on all positional patterns):
  - **Pattern D** — frame alignment now handles titled tops (`┌─ Title ─┐`).
    Width is computed from the full visual width of the top bar (including the
    title) instead of a dash count. Bottom bar is always plain `└─…─┘`.
  - **Pattern A** — arrow column alignment: consecutive lines each containing
    exactly one `→` / `-->` / `──>` are padded so all arrows start at the
    same visual column.
  - **Pattern B** — junction fan alignment: consecutive lines each containing
    exactly one `──┐` / `──┤` / `──┘` connector are padded so all connectors
    start at the same column.
  - **Pattern C** — separator length normalization: all `─`-only lines (≥3
    chars) in the document are normalized to the document-maximum length when
    ≥2 such lines are present.
- All patterns skip fenced code blocks (unless `--processFenced` is set) and
  frame border/inner lines to prevent cross-pattern interference.

### Upgrade notes

No breaking changes. Stop-hook (`feynman-session-start`) calls `autofix()`
with conservative defaults (`processFenced: false`, `convertL11: false`) — all
four patterns fire automatically at session-start. The ±3 column guard and ≥2
consecutive-lines requirement prevent false positives on unrelated prose.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-05-25

### Fixes

- OpenCode `rules.md` is now correctly emptied when feynman is disabled
  (`/feynman off`), and re-written at the correct intensity after
  `/feynman lite|full|ultra`. Previously `installOpenCodeTarget` ignored
  the `enabled` field in `state.json`, leaving stale rules in the file
  OpenCode reads at startup.
- `feynman` skill (SKILL.md) gains step 2b: after any state change, calls
  `feynman install --target opencode` to propagate the new state into
  `rules.md`. This step is a no-op for claude/codex targets (the file
  only exists for opencode).

## 1.2.0 - 2026-05-25

### Features

- **OpenCode target**: `feynman install --target opencode` injects the
  ASCII-diagram rules via OpenCode's native `instructions[]` array in
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. No hook required — OpenCode reads
  the rules file at startup.
- `--target all` (or `--target *`) installs all three targets: claude,
  codex, and opencode. `--target both` retains its legacy meaning
  (claude + codex only).
- `feynman doctor --target opencode` performs a 5-point diagnostic.
- `feynman uninstall --target opencode` removes the rules path from
  `instructions[]` and cleans up the `.feynman/` directory.

### Internal

- `TargetAdapter` interface introduced — `install`, `uninstall`, and
  `doctor` are now dispatched through a typed adapter map. Eliminates the
  if/else ternary per target in the CLI.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-05-22

### Fixes

- Lint engine now understands the sequence-message arrows shipped in 1.1.0.
  L03 recognizes `->>` (sync) and `-->>` (return) as a single `seq-msg` family,
  so a sequence diagram using both does not falsely trip the mixed-arrow-styles
  rule; L05 counts them as connectors so bare-token sequence lines are not
  flagged "no arrow". Mixing flow (`-->`) and sequence (`->>`) arrows in one
  diagram is still flagged (intended — different idioms)
- examples/activity-flow.md: normalized a single-dash `--yes->` straggler to
  `--yes-->` for consistent arrow style

## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-22

### Features

- New lightweight diagram triggers in the injected rules, all using
  token-frugal minimal notation (no heavy frames, no UML boilerplate):
  - sequence messages: `A->>B: msg` (sync) / `A-->>B: ok` (return)
  - activity flow: `[step] -> [decision?] -> [step]` arrow chains
  - C4 context: `Person(x) --> WebApp: label` (no Boundary macros)
  - 2-column comparison via a single `│` separator (not a markdown table)
- Seven design principles baked into the `<contract>` blocks: explicit
  smallest-visual-fits ladder, mutex (now in lite too), terse-label rule,
  horizontal-flow default for ≤5 nodes, single-`│` 2-column compare, and
  plan-then-render (enumerate entities before drawing) for >3 entities
- New lint rule **L14 — blank-line separation**: warns when a fenced diagram
  block is not separated from surrounding prose by a blank line

### Documentation

- New clean examples: sequence-messages, activity-flow, layout-columns,
  mapping-pairs; C4 example realigned to the minimal arrow notation
- README: honest "Prompt caching" section — the rule block sits below
  Anthropic's cache token thresholds, so caching is a harness-level concern,
  not a plugin feature; savings come from SessionStart-only injection +
  concise output

### Internal

- +12 characterization tests close the line-coverage gap; CI coverage gate
  restored from temporary 94% back to 95% (all-files now 96.75%)
- eslint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) added for eslint 10; `npm run
  eslint` (0 findings) is now a CI gate (ubuntu, Node 22)
- `FEYNMAN_RULES_PATH` env override added as a test seam — lets the hook tests
  drive the real source instead of patched copies (feynman-activate.ts 87.83%
  → 98.41%). Production behaviour unchanged when the var is unset
- codex-app-server test now skips gracefully when the server is unreachable;
  suite is 404 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip
- token-heavy example frames (incident-response, activity-sequence, C4
  delivery-readiness) converted to dot-leader lists, modelling the plugin's
  own L11 guidance

## 1.0.1 - 2026-05-22

### Fixes

- Public docs (README pitch, docs/launch.md positioning, CHANGELOG summary)
  no longer claim "status into frames" as the rules-emitted shape. The
  smallest-visual-fits ladder still keeps frame as a last-resort fallback
  when lighter forms lose information — docs now match that contract
- Plan-writer checklist in docs/token-economy-planning.md updated from
  "status frame" to "status list"

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-22

Stability marker after four breaking releases (0.4 IDE compat, 0.5 ABC ruleset,
0.6 ESM, 0.7 SessionStart). Frame blocks are no longer the default for status
visuals — dot-leader and markdown table take over; the smallest-visual-fits
ladder still allows frame as a last resort when lighter forms lose information.

### Changed

- **Breaking behaviour:** rules no longer recommend `frame block` for status
  visuals. `<intensity name="lite|full|ultra">` triggers map `status` to
  `dot-leader list` (default) or `markdown table` for ≥6 items. The
  `<patterns selection="one-of">` block (status→frame, retro→frame,
  handoff→frame, review→frame, incident→frame, release→frame,
  decision→frame, verification→frame, roadmap→frame, phase→frame,
  UAT→frame, risk-register→frame) is removed entirely
- Motivation: frame blocks (`┌─...─┐`) wasted tokens on `─` and `│`
  decoration without adding semantic separation in linear chat output.
  Dot-leader lists and markdown tables convey the same status structure
  with lower visual noise
- Mutex semantics preserved: the `Mutex: at most one primary visual per
  response.` rule moved from `<patterns>` into the `<contract>` block
  of full intensity

### Maintenance

- CI matrix dropped Node 20 (incompatible with `engines.node >=22.6`
  since v0.6.0)
- Release workflow now pins Node 22
- devDependencies bumped via dependabot (PR #3 `@types/node`, #4 eslint 10,
  #5 typescript 6) — merged in this release

### Migration

- Existing installations: run `npx @albinocrabs/feynman install` to pick up
  the new rules. `state.json` and `injections` counter are preserved
- Plugin authors who depended on the `<patterns selection="one-of">` block
  in feynman-activate.md must switch to the survived mutex rule in
  `<contract>`

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **Breaking behaviour:** rules now inject only at `SessionStart`
  (`startup|resume|compact|clear`). The `UserPromptSubmit` hook is removed.
  Token cost per session drops by ~1 100 tokens × number of user turns.
  Rules survive `/compact` and `/clear` natively via the expanded matcher.
- Motivation: per-turn injection was redundant once rules entered session
  history. Cache-invalidation framing was investigated and rejected — the
  verified cause of cache misses in long sessions is `/compact` summarisation
  rewriting history, not feynman injection. The real gain is reduced context
  noise and fewer tokens per turn.
- Installer (`feynman install`) now registers only the `SessionStart` hook.
  Legacy `UserPromptSubmit` feynman entries are removed during any install
  (migration path for v0.6.x users).
- `feynman doctor` no longer checks for a `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry.

  - lint compliance: 100% (364/364 tests pass)

### Evaluation

- 7-arm measurement on 50-prompt corpus (eval/v0.5.0-compliance/)
- all 4 candidates (A/B/C/ABC) exceed −20% verbosity threshold with 100% lint
